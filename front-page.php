				<h1>About Me</h1>
				I began learning web development in the middle of 2012. I was interested in learning something that I could use to earn and that would challenge me. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, and then took a break for a while. Then in the summer of 2013, I picked it up again and learned Javascript. I started working on projects for other people that summer, starting with Wordpress. I worked on a few Wordpress sites, and then worked on an HTML5 mobile app. Next I built the <a href="http://bridgeortunnel.com">bridgeOrTunnel</a> app and website. I continue to look for projects that will challenge me to expand my skills and learn new things. Think you have a project for me? <a href="#contact">Let me know!</a>
